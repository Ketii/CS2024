To this, we add the information corresponding to output per generation type, obtained from ENTSOE (TODOREF). These are monthly data files providing 15-minute interval data for actual generation output and actual consumption for different production types. The files from January 1st, 2015, to March 15th, 2024, are merged into one comprehensive dataset. Each month contains information on production date (observed every 15 minutes in Germany) (\texttt{DateTime}), area codes (\texttt{MapCode}, nominal, 56 categories), production type (\texttt{ProductionType}, nominal, 20 categories), generation output (\texttt{ActualGenerationOutput}, in MW, metric), and consumption (\texttt{ActualConsumption}, in MW, metric). Other variables are not considered.

To combine the monthly files, data specific to the German market (\texttt{MapCode} = "DE") is extracted from each file individually. The data is then aggregated to hourly intervals by summing the values. Germany has a maximum of 17 production type categories, but due to some having little to no observed values, they are consolidated into five new categories: 1. \texttt{Biomass}, 2. \texttt{Fossil} (including \texttt{Fossil Brown coal/Lignite}, \texttt{Fossil Coal-derived gas}, \texttt{Fossil Gas}, \texttt{Fossil Hard coal}, \texttt{Fossil oil}), 3. \texttt{Geothermal}, 4. \texttt{Hydro} (including \texttt{Hydro Pumped Storage}, \texttt{Hydro Run-of-river and poundage}, \texttt{Hydro Water Reservoir}), and 5. \texttt{Other} (including \texttt{Other}, \texttt{Other renewable}, \texttt{Solar}, \texttt{Waste}, \texttt{Wind Offshore}, \texttt{Wind Onshore}). For each category, the mean actual values are calculated.

Each file is then reshaped into a wide format, with the production type categories as columns. The resulting individual files contain 744 observations each (except for March), combining to a total of 80,688 observations in the final dataset.
