# Data has been sampled from 01.01.2015 to 15.03.2024 leading to a sample size of 80688 hourly observations. 
# All dates have been converted to date-time objects (POSIXct objects) using the “ymd_hms” function and equivalent functions from the “lubridate” package corre-sponding to the given time format. The time zone has been set up to Etc/GMT-1.
# Data on hourly total energy demand on the grid in MWh („Total Load“), hourly Imports and Exports of Electricity from and to Germany  in MWh and quarter hourly data on the detailed breakdown of electricity generation by different energy sources („Output per Generation Type“) were gathered on ENTSO-E and provided for the purpose of analysis in this report.
# Since the data on hourly total energy demand on the grid in MWh („Total Load“) was reported hourly it was subject to Daylight Saving Time. To account for the “spring forward”, the observation reported for 01:00:00 on the “spring forward” day was duplicated and assigned to 02:00:00 of the same day. In order to account for the “fall back” the observation reported for the duplicate hour (second observation on the “fall back” day reported for 02:00:00) was deleted manually.

With respect to hourly Imports and Exports of Electricity from and to Germany there were 295697 missing observations. All of them were replaced by zeroes. All Exports (recorded as positive values in the provided data) and Imports (recorded as negative values in the provided data) have been summed in order to construct the Variable „Total Net Exports“ which is used in modelling. Daylight Saving Time adjustment was handled the same way as with „Total Load“ data.

Information on daily average gas and CO2 future prices were gathered from the Euro-pean Energy Exchange (EEX) and provided for the purpose of analysis in this report. With respect to daily average CO2 future prices (“CO2”) there was one observation provided for each day . All daily average CO2 future prices were replicated twenty-four times to harmonize that daily data with the hourly Total Load series.
With respect to daily average gas future prices (“Gas”) there were multiple observa-tions reported for each day. There are two reasons for that. The first reason is that until 01.10.2021 Germany had two virtual trading points (NetConnect Germany and Gaspool), which merged to Trading Hub Europe on that date. Until 01.10.2021 data reported by NetConnect Germany and after that date data reported by Trading Hub Europe has been used. 16 daily gas future prices were missing and were therefore filled in with zeros. The second reason is that for each trading day there were multiple average gas future prices depending on the delivery day. They were averaged over the trading day, such that each trading day got a mean average gas future price as-signed. All daily mean average gas future prices were replicated twenty-four times to harmonize that daily data with the hourly “Total Load” series. When merging this data with the “Total Load” data, 24480 hourly  observations were missing, because there were no gas future prices reported for weekends. In order to handle these missing observations the last valid mean average gas future price was carried forward using the “na.locf” function from the “zoo” package.
Information on forecasted daily average temperature in Germany in degrees Celsius as well as day-ahead forecasts for wind energy and solar energy generation in MWh in Germany was provided for the purpose of analysis in this report.
With respect to forecasted daily average temperature in Germany (“Temperature”) there were multiple observations provided for the same day. Moreover, seventy-five observations exhibited missing temperature data. This missing data was filled in with zeros. Afterwards, the forecasted daily average temperature was averaged over the day for which the forecast was made, such that for each day there was only one mean forecasted average temperature. All those mean forecasted average tempera-tures were replicated twenty-four times to harmonize that daily data with the hourly Total Load series.
With respect to day-ahead forecasts for solar energy generation in Germany (“Solar”) there were multiple mean forecasts provided for the same day. These mean forecasts were averaged over the day for which the forecast was made and replicated twenty-four times to harmonize that daily data with the hourly Total Load series. When merg-ing this data with the “Total Load” data, 264 pseudo-hourly observations were missing. In order to handle these missing observations the last valid average mean forecast was carried forward using the “na.locf” function from the “zoo” package.

Day-ahead forecasts for wind energy generation in Germany were gathered from two sources, one covering the period from 01.01.2015 to 20.03.16 (“Source I”) and the other covering the period from 21.03.2016 to 15.03.2024 (“Source II”). 
In Source II there were multiple mean forecasts reported by different transmission system operators. For the purpose of the analysis in this report data reported by Am-piron, 50Hertz and TransnetBW was used. These mean forecasts were averaged over the day for which the forecast was made and replicated twenty-four times (“Wind I”) to harmonize that daily data with the hourly Total Load series.
In Source I there was one hourly forecast for on- and offshore wind generation report-ed for each hour. Forecasted on- and offshore wind generation were summed to get a forecast for wind energy generation (“Wind II”). In forecasted offshore wind genera-tion, there were twenty-four missing observations which were filled in with zeroes. Alt-hough the data provided in “Source I” exhibited an hourly frequency and hence could have been used directly in modelling the hourly Total Load series, it was averaged over the day for which the forecast was made and replicated twenty-four times in or-der to maintain consistency when it comes to the construction of the “Wind” variable since this is how this variable is constructed in the period from 21.03.2016 to 15.03.2024. Afterwards, “Wind I” and “Wind II” were stacked into one variable (“Wind”). When merging this data with the “Total Load” data, 313 pseudo-hourly ob-servations were missing. In order to handle these missing observations the last valid value of “Wind” was carried forward using the “na.locf” function from the “zoo” pack-age.
The variable „Holiday“ was self-constructed. It indicates whether an observed time point falls on a holiday. It is equal to „1“, if the time point is on a holiday, and „0“ if it is not. This variable accounts for all national public German holidays  in between 01.01.2015 and 15.03.2024. The R function „Easter“ from the package „timeDate“ has been used to identify Easter and the holidays which depend on it . The functions „NewYearsDay“, „ChristmasDay“ and „BoxingDay“ from the same package have been used to identify the corresponding holidays. Lobour Day (01.05) and the Day of Ger-man Unity (03.10) were identified by concatenating the dates in parentheses with the years of interest (2015 to 2024). Subsequently, all hourly dates from 01.01.2015 to 15.03.2024 were screened for whether they correspond to one of the specified holi-days. 
Similarly, the variable „Is_Weekend“ was self-constructed and indicates whether an observed time point falls on a weekend day. It is equal to „1“, if the time point is on a weekend day (Saturday or Sunday), and „0“ for all other days. The function „wday“ from the package „lubridate“ was used to identify to what weekday all examined hourly time points belong to.

  1 Imports of Electricity from Germany to (and Exports of Electricity from Germany to) the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Sweden, Austria, France, Poland, Norway and Belgium.  
2    Each daily average CO2 future price was recorded multiple times. Each repeating observation was removed.
3 They are in fact pseudo-hourly because this is daily data replicated twenty-four times.
4   National public German holidays include: New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labour Day, Ascension Day, Whit Monday, Day of German Unity, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
5 These holidays include: Good Friday, Easter Monday, Ascension Day and Whit Monday.
